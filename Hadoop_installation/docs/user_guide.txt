User scripts should be kept in ansible node(Node which has ansible installed).
Pre-requisite:
1.	Install ansible on ansible server-node.
2.	Ssh key from ansible node should be copied to the cluster nodes.
3.	In ansible server-node, Python version should be 2.7

User inputs before running the script on ansible node:
1.	“/etc/ansible/hosts” files has to be updated with list of nodes for each service.
2.	Update the “files/hosts” file with list of  IP addresses and hostnames
3.	Update the “files/resolv.conf” file with the list of DNS servers
4.	Update “settings.cfg” file with network and hostname.
5.	Subnet & cluster name has to be given as an input to prepare_nodes.yaml
6.	Subnet has to be given as input for Hadoop_install.yaml for mapr installation.

/etc/ansible/hosts file will have the following format:
[allnodes]  #Should have all node IP addresses
192.168.0.46
192.168.0.66
 [mapr-cldb]
192.168.0.46
192.168.0.66
[mapr-zookeeper]
192.168.0.46
 [mapr-nfs]
192.168.0.46
[mapr-webserver]
192.168.0.46
[mapr-fileserver]
192.168.0.46
192.168.0.66
[mapr-jobtracker]
192.168.0.46
 [mapr-resourcemanager]
192.168.0.46
[mapr-historyserver]
192.168.0.46
[mapr-nodemanager]
192.168.0.66
[mapr-tasktracker]
192.168.0.66
[squid3]
192.168.0.46
[ntp-server]
192.168.0.46
User should enter the list of IP’s where each service should run.

Steps to Run the ansible script:
1.	Following script is used to install the pre-requisites:
ansible-playbook prepare_node.yaml --extra-vars="subnet=192.168.0.0/16    cluster_name=new1_cluster "

2.	Following script is used to install mapr packages:
ansible-playbook hadoop_install.yaml --extra-vars="subnet=192.168.0.0/16"

3.	Following script is used to add the license to the cluster
ansible-playbook add_license.yaml --extra-vars="path=path/to/license.txt    cluster_name=new1_cluster "

Note:
a.	Cluster_id can be known by logging into Hadoop cluster website with the credentials (mapr / mapr)
b.	Go to manage licenses & get the cluster_id
c.	Go to the mapr website: https://www.mapr.com Register & login
d.	Click on “register a cluster”, give cluster_id, cluster_name & register
e.	Click on “view key”, Copy the license key into a file Eg: license.txt & place it in ansible node.


4.	Following script is used to validate the cluster after license is added
python validate.py 

5.	Following command is used cleanup/uninstall mapr packages on  all the nodes
ansible-playbook hadoop_cleanup.yaml

Test Environment: 
This has been tested on a 2 node setup with Ubuntu as an operating system.
